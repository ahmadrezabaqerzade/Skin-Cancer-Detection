In this project we purpose to train our dataset in 3 part:

1)train with custom model: in this part we write a model from basicly and we train dataset.

2)train dataset with sequential model: we training a dataset with CNN-models more than part1 and also we using data augmentation because our data is small.

3)train dataset with proper models: using proper models can be very usfully because this models are trained on big datasets. In this part we use from resnet152 and Densenet.

Our dataset certain a 9-type patient but unhappilly is small.
In the first two part we use a data augmentation for training more and we saw that model's better.
